PyTorch utilities for model inference and data handling.

Central PyTorch utility toolkit for device selection, batch prediction,
DataLoader construction, and TorchScript model loading utilities.

Key Features:
- Automatically select the appropriate device (CPU/GPU) for PyTorch operations.
- Run model inference on single batches.
- Build PyTorch DataLoaders from preprocessed sample data.
- Load TorchScript-exported models for inference.

Main Functions:
    set_device(): Detects and returns the optimal torch.device.
    predict_batch(model, batch, device): Performs inference on a single batch.
    build_dataloader(combined_samples, batch_size): Constructs a DataLoader and returns associated metadata.
    load_model(model_path, device): Loads cached TorchScript model and prepares it for inference.

Example Usage:
    # Set device
    device = set_device()

    # Load model
    model = load_model("path/to/model.pt", device)

    # Build dataloader
    dataloader, cml_ids, times = build_dataloader(combined_samples, batch_size)

    # Run batch inference in loop
    for batch in dataloader:
        outputs = predict_batch(model, batch, device)
