def calc_coverage_mask(cml_list, xgrid, ygrid, max_dist_from_cml):
        """ Generate a coverage mask with a certain area around all CMLs

        Parameters
        ----------

        cml_list : list
            List of Comlink objects
        xgrid : array
            2D matrix of x locations
        ygrid : array
            2D matrix of y locations
        max_dist_from_cml : float
            Maximum distance from a CML path that should be considered as
            covered. The units must be the same as for the coordinates of the
            CMLs. Hence, if lat-lon is used in decimal degrees, this unit has
            also to be used here. Note that the different scaling of lat-lon
            degrees for higher latitudes is not accounted for.

        Returns
        -------

        grid_points_covered_by_cmls : array of bool
            2D array with size of `xgrid` and `ygrid` with True values where
            the grid point is within the area considered covered.
