    invdisttree = Invdisttree( X, z )  -- data points, values
    interpol = invdisttree( q, nnear=3, eps=0, p=1, weights=None, stat=0 )
        interpolates z from the 3 points nearest each query point q;
        For example, interpol[ a query point q ]
        finds the 3 data points nearest q, at distances d1 d2 d3
        and returns the IDW average of the values z1 z2 z3
            (z1/d1 + z2/d2 + z3/d3)
            / (1/d1 + 1/d2 + 1/d3)
            = .55 z1 + .27 z2 + .18 z3  for distances 1 2 3

        q may be one point, or a batch of points.
        eps: approximate nearest, dist <= (1 + eps) * true nearest
        p: use 1 / distance**p
        weights: optional multipliers for 1 / distance**p, of the same shape as q
        stat: accumulate wsum, wn for average weights

    How many nearest neighbors should one take ?
    a) start with 8 11 14 .. 28 in 2d 3d 4d .. 10d; see Wendel's formula
    b) make 3 runs with nnear= e.g. 6 8 10, and look at the results --
        |interpol 6 - interpol 8| etc., or |f - interpol*| if you have f(q).
        I find that runtimes don't increase much at all with nnear -- ymmv.

    p=1, p=2 ?
        p=2 weights nearer points more, farther points less.
        In 2d, the circles around query points have areas ~ distance**2,
        so p=2 is inverse-area weighting. For example,
            (z1/area1 + z2/area2 + z3/area3)
            / (1/area1 + 1/area2 + 1/area3)
            = .74 z1 + .18 z2 + .08 z3  for distances 1 2 3
        Similarly, in 3d, p=3 is inverse-volume weighting.

    Scaling:
        if different X coordinates measure different things, Euclidean distance
        can be way off.  For example, if X0 is in the range 0 to 1
        but X1 0 to 1000, the X1 distances will swamp X0;
        rescale the data, i.e. make X0.std() ~= X1.std() .

    A nice property of IDW is that it's scale-free around query points:
    if I have values z1 z2 z3 from 3 points at distances d1 d2 d3,
    the IDW average
        (z1/d1 + z2/d2 + z3/d3)
        / (1/d1 + 1/d2 + 1/d3)
    is the same for distances 1 2 3, or 10 20 30 -- only the ratios matter.
    In contrast, the commonly-used Gaussian kernel exp( - (distance/h)**2 )
    is exceedingly sensitive to distance and to h.
